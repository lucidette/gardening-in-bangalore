A sedimentation test offers a more precise method for determining soil texture. The process involves:

1. Gather materials: A clear one-quart jar with straight sides and a lid.
2. Collect soil: Dig 6-8 inches deep, filling the jar â…“ full. Remove stones, gravel, and organic matter.
3. Prepare the mixture: Add a few tablespoons of liquid dish detergent and fill with water to one inch below the rim.
4. Agitate: Shake for at least 10 minutes.
5. Let settle: Place undisturbed for 24 hours minimum.
6. Observe layers: Sand at the bottom, followed by silt, clay, and possibly organic matter.
7. Measure and calculate: Determine the percentage of each layer by dividing its height by the total height.
8. Adjust for weight: Multiply sand percentage by 1.19, silt by 0.87, and clay by 0.94.

The resulting percentages can be used with a soil texture triangle to classify the soil type. For example, 70% sand, 20% silt, and 10% clay indicates sandy loam, while 50% sand, 20% silt, and 30% clay suggests clay loam.
