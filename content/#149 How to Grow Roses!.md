## Highlights
- While it may be tempting to fill your rose garden with a wide assortment, you are likely to end up with a disorderly array and too many plants for the space. A few well-chosen varieties will give you more satisfaction than dozens of mismatched plants that don’t work in harmony. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j3r01g3vffvhfezwwpgr4f2q))
- To get the most out of your rose, it is generally best to:
  Plant in a sunny spot, which gets at least 4-6 hours of sunlight a day. Generally, the more sun the better. In especially hot climates, roses do best when they are protected from the hot afternoon sun. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j3r024y3v5hy2wgwkjmgb6ap))
- Add Mycorrhizal Fungi around the sides and the bottom of the planting hole. This will aid root development and will lead to a healthier rose. Mix a generous amount of garden compost, Bokashi, horn shavings, cow manure and plant the rose bush in the hole. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j3r0b8r9shqmcbsn8eg7yggf))
- 6. Fertilizing For rose plants on the ground, feed twice a year: in March/April before flowering in mid-summer after the first flush of flowers Use a mix of composted manure, and other organic and natural fertilizers. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j3r0e4t4zz9axj6kqdw2kbe5))

- Neem oil also works against many other pests & they're organic. Ants raise & protect aphids to drink their secretion so one way to stop aphids is to block ants’ access to your rose with a mix of powdered sugar & baking soda in ratio 1:1 Black spot is also a common fungal disease
  caused by too much rain or getting the leaves wet from watering. It develops black spots on the leaves, eventually causing them to turn yellow and drop off. While there is no cure, you should detect it early and remove any infected leaves then spray rose plants with neem oil to prevent it from spreading. 9. Pruning
  Pruning may sound tricky but is, in fact, generally quick and easy once you get the hang of it. Different types of roses need different approaches, but late winter/early spring (February-April) is often a good time for pruning roses.

- After the first year of flowering: Cut back the flowering shoots by 7-12cm and any very strong shoots that are disproportionate to the rest of the plant. Remove any dead, dying, damaged and diseased stems. Remove any foliage that remains. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j3r0h3a9q51n0e6bkf7m8q68))

- Companion Plants for Rose  Planting roses with companion plants can improve their appearance, health, and extend the color and visual interest of your garden. Lavender attracts more pollinating bees and protect roses from pests like aphids.
  Sage, thyme, rosemary, garlic… are all great herbal companions that produce highly scented leaves that deter pests. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j3r0mwnvj87ppvj6p4v2njwx))
