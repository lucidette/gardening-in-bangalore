### Growing tips
- With regard to fertiliser, most orchids are not heavy feeders.  [[Cymbidiums]], [[Catasetinae]] and [[Vandas]] like more fertiliser, but feeding them once a month on average should be enough. [garden.org](https://garden.org/thread/view/100876/Orchid-HELP-thread/)
- You must remember the simple fact that these are epiphytic plants. The new potting mix that you use has to take into account the root system of that particular orchid. An orchid with either short skinny roots or longer and slender roots does not belong in a mix of coarse particle size. That is a bad direction to go.  Number two. The opposite side of that coin is also generally true. Any orchid with pencil thick roots does not belong in a fine mix featuring very small sized pieces.
