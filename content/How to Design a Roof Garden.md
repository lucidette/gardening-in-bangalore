## Highlights
- One of the mistakes I think people make with roof gardens is that they aren’t ambitious enough. If you think about a successful garden, there will be lots of plants making patterns, shadows and creative views. You want to create the same effects on a roof terrace, so a few pots on the edge of the terrace just won't do, and will always look like a linear, unrelaxed array of plants. For the Plimsoll roof terrace we intersected the space to create long views and garden rooms. We also used layered planting with planters of different heights. I think this is one of the elements that was most successful. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gt3pnjy322emjf3jthh310bk))
- One of the things you don't always think about is wind, so you need to find a spot which is fairly sheltered if possible. The other thing that is worth thinking about is that roof terraces and balconies are often viewed from inside and so it's a good idea to bring plants right up to the windows so you feel part of the garden without even stepping out.

- It's best to choose Mediterranean plants that are used the harsh environment of a dry hot and windy space. Do select things with small leaves that allow the wind to pass through. I often find that lavender, santolina, grasses and herbs do well. Mounding *Ceanothus* is good for early colour and for breaking the line of rectangular pots. Short irises are also a good choice. Don’t forget to choose plants that will spill out of the planters or dangle down so you break the straight lines, making it all look quite natural.
