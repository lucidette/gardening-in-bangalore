## Highlights
- A frequent question asked to me is , what are the nectaring plants for a butterfly garden. I would say the most effective “garden” ones are Ixora, lantana, aster varieties, buttercups etc. But I am a big supporter of native vegetation so my hands down choice for nectaring would be Heliotrope. Everybody says lantana but observe a bunch of butterflies on a heliotrope for a day and then decide for yourself. You can literally touch them as they are so intoxicated by the nectar.

- Apart from nectar certain butterflies prefer decaying matter. It is not commonly known but some butterflies prefer only decaying matter and do not visit flowers at all. Bird droppings can be ideal way to create this alternative unless you are willing to spare a decaying banana everyday. Butterflies like the evening browns never visits flowers !

- I live in a semi urban setup , so I resorted to tree based butterfly larval host planting. The main advantage is that they aesthetically fit the bill of a garden and  are also  low maintenance. Trees like Cassia fistula are ideal for Emigrants and trees like Ashoka are magnets for Jays. Please do refer the list of trees at the end of the post.
